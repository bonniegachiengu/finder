'''
pathfinder.py is a module that provides a class for finding files in a directory tree.

The PathFinder class is a subclass of the os.path module's DirEntry class. 
It provides a method for finding files in a directory tree that match a specified pattern, in this case extensions. 
The find method takes a directory path and a pattern as arguments, and returns a list 
of file paths that match the pattern and the file name and file title.

The PathFinder class is used by the Findex class in the finder module to find files in a directory tree for indexing.
